# WinUITabSample

This sample is an investigation into whether an existing product built using WPF and the Modern UI nuget package that is now out of support, could have a similar presentation if it was written in WinUI using either the TabView or NavigationView control.
Because there is no dynamic tab creation for this exercise it was considered that the NavigationView provided a better match.

For reference Modern UI for WPF (MUI) can be found here
